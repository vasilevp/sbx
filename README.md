# SoundboardX
SoundboardX is a simple, minimalistic soundboard.

# Features
- Instant monitoring: you can hear what is being played
- Archive support: you can store your sound packs in archives to reduce clutter
- Overlay: see the soundboard UI on top of all windows, even games (works with borderless windows, might not work with true fullscreen)
- Single binary: simply download and you're ready to go
- Big soundpack support: the only limit is readability. You can easily cram at least 200 sounds

# Requirements
- Windows 8+
- [.NET 6.0+](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) (you will be prompted to install it in case you don't have it already)
